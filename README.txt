Please have a look at the files in the "doc" folder.

Stendhal depends on the Sun Java Runtime which you can download
at http://java.com

After installing the Java Runtime you should be able to start
Stendhal by double clicking on the stendhal-x.xx.jar.

If this does not work for some reason, please go to a terminal
window and execute
 java -jar stendhal-x.xx.jar
in the stendhal folder. x.xx is the version number.
