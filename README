Stendhal
--------
This is a implementation of multiplayer adventures game with a Zelda look.
This game is not playable right now and it is only a very geek demostration of
the arianne engine.

Description
-----------
The game is actually in *heavy* development. In fact I won't call it game :)
You can move and change zone.

Current Version
---------------
Version 0.02


How to make it work
-------------------
http://arianne.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/HowToBuildStendhal

No warranties. But let me know if it doesn't works.


How to play
-----------
You need arianne's Stendhal client in order to be able to play Stendhal.
