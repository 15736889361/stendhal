Stendhal
--------
This is a implementation of multiplayer adventures game with a Zelda look.
Your task is to talk with other people in the village and find jobs to do that 
will drive to interesting quests that will reveal the hidden plot behind the 
world of stendhal

In stendhal, you can also just walk around, chat with people, buy and sell 
items and kill some of them :)
Some of these people are NPC, they will give you tasks to accomplish and 
hints to solve your quest.

stendhal is totally developed using Java and Java2D, so it is portable to 
anything running Java 1.5.0.
