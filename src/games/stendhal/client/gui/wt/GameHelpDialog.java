Stendhal features a world in constant evolution, with tons of interesting quests to accomplish and thousands of friends to meet. And the best of it is that it is a never ending game :)\n<br>\n<hr width=95%>\n<h2>What do I need to play Stendhal?</h2><br>\nStendhal is a Java game and works in any platform that is able to run the Sun Java JRE, that includes:<p>\n\n    * Windows<br>\n    * Linux<br>\n    * MacOS <p>\n\nSo you need at least Java 1.5 to run it. Right now Stendhal won't work with GCJ, so if you are a developer with experience in GCJ, you may want to help porting Stendhal to SDLjava. <br>\n<hr width=95%>\n<h1>Setting up the game</h1><br>\n<h2> Creating an account</h2><br>\nTo create an account, just open the game and click on Create account.<br>\n<img src=\"http://arianne.sourceforge.net/wiki_images/createaccount_001.png\"><p>\nNow fill the fields:<p>\n\n    * Choose your Stendhal server. If you are not sure about what to do, simply choose the default one. In case you want to connect to a different server, please enter it's hostname there.<br>\n    * Port. Usually Stendhal servers runs at port 32160.<br>\n    * Username. It is the name of your avatar in the Stendhal world.<br>\n    * Password. Type in your password twice. It will secure your access to Stendhal, so choose a good one.<br>\n    * Email. Just in case we need to reset the password or contact you. <p>\n\nYour account will be ready immediately. <br>\n<img src=\"http://www.myimagebuddy.com/uploads/0c8123fd60.png\"><p>\n<hr width=95%><br>\n<h2> Downloading the game</h2><br>\nYou can run it directly using Java Webstart (this means you do not need to download anything, just click the webstart link and if Java is installed on your system the game will start) or you can download the compiled java program to your computer at http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1111\n<br>\n<hr width=95% height=5px>\n<h1>Controls and Game settings</h1><br>\n<h2>Starting the game</h2><br>\nTo launch Stendhal use Java webstart or by running the stendhal-0.XX.jar file that is in the stendhal download package.<br>\n<img src=\"http://arianne.sourceforge.net/wiki_images/manual_000.jpg\"><p>\nClick on the Login to Stendhal button and enter your account information.<br>\nBe sure to choose the server where you created your account (the name will be the same as the site you went to to create the account in the first place. The default option is probably correct) and finally click on Login to Server.<br>\n<img src=\"http://arianne.sourceforge.net/wiki_images/manual_001.jpg\"><p>\nA progress bar will appear and soon you will be connected to the world.<br>\n<img src=\"http://arianne.sourceforge.net/wiki_images/manual_002.jpg\"><p>\nIf the server is down (not online) you will get an error message explaining this. In this case either try again later or create a new account on another server.\n<hr width=95%><br>\n<h2>Game screen</h2>\n<img src=\"http://www.myimagebuddy.com/uploads/18203b1193.png\"><p>\n   1.  Minimap<br>\n      The minimap shows the actual position of the player with a cross. Minimap only shows the actual zone non walkable areas.<br>\n   2. Player's bag<br>\n      This is the bag where you can store up to twelve items. If the bag closes and you want to open it again, click on settings Windows(6) and click on player inventory.<br>\n   3. Chat line<br>\n      You write the text to talk to other players and npcs here. You can also write commands here. There is a basic help writing /help<br>\n   4. Dialogs log<br>\n      Here are all the messages received in the current session stored (game messages and player messages). It is very useful for conversational proposes.<br>\n   5. Player's character window<br>\n      You can equip items as weapons, armor, legs, helmets and boots to obtain advantages.<br>\n   6. Settings window<br>\n      Contains buttons to reopen the minimap, the player inventory and the player bag.<br>\n   7. Game area<br>\n      All the gameplay happens here. <p>\n<hr width=95%><br>\n<h2>Basic controls</h2>\n<h3>Move</h3><p>\n\nUse the <b>keyboard arrows</b> to move around on the Map.<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.myimagebuddy.com/uploads/872976a7b2.png\"><p>\nYou must hold down the direction keys to make the character to move. Your character will collide with elements that exists on the world, like other players and walls.<p>\n\nAlternatively you can move by double clicking on an empty place of the game area.<p>\n\nYou also collide with map borders. When you reach a map border your screen won't move any further and two things might happen:<p>\n\n    * if an area exists next to the area you are in, you will move from your current area to the new area (you will be transfered to the new zone).<br>\n    * if no area exists nothing will happen and you will simply collide and stop. <br>\n<h3>Movement-lock trick</h3>\nIf you make the graphics window lose the focus while keeping an arrow key pressed, your character will keep going in that direction.<p>\n\nWhen your character collides with an object or changes zones it will stop, but you can resume its movement in the locked direction by pressing an arrow key of a different direction.<p>\n\nThe movement-lock is released only when you press the arrow key of the locked direction of movement.<br>\n<h3>Passing Through Doors</h3>\nYou can simply pass through the doorway by using the <b>keyboard arrows</b>. In the case that there is someone standing in front of the doorway and blocking it you still can pass through the door if you can get next to the door diagonally: just <br>right click</b> on the door and choose <b>use</b>.<br>\n<h3>Moving With An Animal</h3>\nave an animal following you such as a sheep, to change zones the animal MUST be within visible distance from your charater. To find out where your animal is, type <b>/where <name of animal></b> ... for example <b>/where sheep</b><br>\n<h3>Face</h3>\nWhen attacking someone or talking to someone it is nice to face them. To do this press <b>Ctrl and a directional arrow</b> to face in that direction. It is just an eye candy action as it has no effect on the game rules. <br>\n<h3>Moving Items</h3>\nDuring the game you will find or buy items such as swords and shields. To move these items around the world, use the <b>left click and drag</b> to the place you want them to be. You need to be next to the item. To drop a smaller amount of a stackable item use the /drop command. Say you have 2000 money and want to give 100 money away: /drop 100 money<br>\n<h3>Managing Inventory</h3>\nYou can manage your inventory by dressing items, dropping them to floor or by storing them on your backpack. On all the cases the procedure is the same: click on the item and drop it to the desired position.<p>\n\nKeep in mind that you must be near an item to equip it and that you can't drop it further than 8 positions from you. <br>\n<img src=\"http://www.myimagebuddy.com/uploads/aada91f09e.png\"><p>\nDrag and drop the item in inventory slot you want.<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.myimagebuddy.com/uploads/68db269bb7.png\"><p>\nAnd you have equipped it.<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.myimagebuddy.com/uploads/6f9d28a0b8.png\"><p>\nYou can equip any item in any slot right now, but this will change.<br>\n<h3>Other Actions</h3>\nClick the <b>right mouse button</b> over objects to see a contextual menu (which will include actions that can be performed on the object) and use the <b>left mouse button</b> to choose an action from the menu You can click outside the area of the menu to abort it.<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.myimagebuddy.com/uploads/75fc9949fd.png\"><P>\n<h3>Open Game Dialog log</h3>\nIn case you have closed the game dialog (the window where all the text and game information appears) you can open it again with <b>Ctrl+L</b> (hold Control Key and L key)<br>\n<img src=\"http://arianne.sourceforge.net/wiki_images/manual_008.jpg\"><p>\nThis dialog contains all the important events that happen in game so it is advised to have it visible.<p>\n\nUse <b>Shift+UP arrow</b> or <b>Shift+DOWN arrow</b> (hold Shift and press arrows) to put in your dialog text bar the last written sentence. Each time you press the up arrow (while still holding the shift key) you go further back in the history of your previously written sentences. When you use the down arrow instead you can go forward. That way you don't have to write again previously used sentences, for example, when you sell items. <br>\n<h3>Exit Game</h3>\nPress <b>ESC</b> to exit. You will be prompted again to either really quit or return to the game. Alternatively you can simply close the window. In any case, your information about your inventory stuff and position in the game is automatically saved before you quit the game. <br>\n<img src=\"http://www.myimagebuddy.com/uploads/4948e3941d.png\"><p>\n<h2>Player Communication</h2>\nTo communicate with other players simply type! Press <b>Enter</b> to send your chat message. A chat bubble will appear under your character and a new line will appear in the Game log dialog. This kind of communication is public and visible to every player in world, although you will only see text for players near you.<p>\n\nAlternatively you can write: <p>\n&nbsp <i>/tell playername text to send</i><p>\nThis allows you to write to a single character privately. For example:<p>\n&nbsp <i>  /tell miguel This game rules, really. I have rated it 10/10 :)</i><p>\nIn order to ease the communication you can write to the lasted player you msged using // <p>\n&nbsp <i>  // Really man!, go and rate it.</i><p>\nYou can also write any of the administrators that are in game to request support by writting /support<p>\n&nbsp <i>  /support I keep getting an out of memory exception, so the game crashes, can I avoid this?</i><p>\n<h2>Finding Persons</h2>\nYou can discover who is online by using the command /who.<br>\n&nbsp <i> /who</i><p>\nThis will show a list of the players that are online now with their levels.<p>\n\nYou can find out a players position by querying server using /where player name <Br>\n&nbsp <i> /where miguel</i><p>\n<h2>Getting Help</h2>\nYou can get help about the previous commands by using the command /help. <br>\n&nbsp <i>/help</i><p>\nThis will return a list of the commands that are available to the player with a brief explanation of their usage and parameters. <p>\n<h1>Gameplay</h1>\n<h2></h2>\nYou can and need to talk to other characters to get help and to find out about quests to complete.\n\nThere are two kinds of characters:\n\n    * Other Players with their name printed in white\n    * Non Player Characters (NPC) with their name printed in light blue \n\nAll of the NPCs reply to <b>Hi</b> (most of them reply also to <b>Hello</b> and <b>Hola</b>), so greet them and ask them for <b>help</b>, their <b>offer</b>, or <b>quests</b>.<p>\n\nSome of them will <b>sell</b> and <b>buy</b> sheep or items, others <b>heal</b> you, and others are simply \"useless\" <p>\n<img src=\"http://www.myimagebuddy.com/uploads/e157c8d5a1.png\"><p>\nAn example of a conversation with Xin Blanca could be:<br>\n<i>\n&nbsp <miguel> hi<br>\n&nbsp <Xin Blanca> Greetings! How may I help you?<br>\n&nbsp <miguel> help<br>\n&nbsp <Xin Blanca> I buy and sell several items, ask me for my offer<br>\n&nbsp <miguel> offer<br>\n&nbsp <Xin Blanca> I sell wooden_shield,knife,club,leather_legs,dress,small_axe,leather_helmet, I buy studded_shield,short_sword,sword,<br>\n&nbsp <miguel> buy leather_legs<br>\n&nbsp <Xin Blanca> leather_legs costs 30. Do you want to buy?<br>\n&nbsp <miguel> yes<br>\n&nbsp <Xin Blanca> Congratulations! Here is your leather_legs!<br>\n&nbsp <miguel> Bye<br>\n&nbsp <Xin Blanca> Bye.<p>\n</i>\nSometimes you can buy more than one item at the same time:\n&nbsp <i> <miguel> buy 10 minor_potion<i><p>\nNotice that names of items doesn't contain spaces between words (they use _ as separator) and the name of the item is always singular independently of the amount being bought.<p>\n\nYou can also get more than one item produced at once: <br>\n<i>\n&nbsp <miguel> mill 10 flour<br>\n&nbsp <Jenny> I can only mill 10 flour if you bring me 50 grain.<p>\n</i>\nSome NPCs like to talk to you. If they say something in <font color=blue>blue</font> you can repeat it to get further information.<br>\n<i>\n&nbsp <Tad> I have a <font color=blue>task</font> for you.<bR>\n&nbsp <miguel> task<br>\n&nbsp <Tad> I need you to get a <font color=blue>flask</font> from <font color=blue>Margaret</font><p>\n</i>\n<h2>Items</h2>\nItems such as armour and weapons can be found in the Stendhal world, or bought for hard earned cash. (Hint: Explore the tavern, I've heard a shady character goes there to sell his stuff... though it might be stolen!)<p>\n\nItems increase your Attack or Defence values accordingly. They must be equipped by dragging them onto a particular section of the player in the Top right GUI. This little representation of your player allows you to visualise what they are wearing/using. <p>\n<hr width=95%>\n\n<h2>World of Stendhal</h2>\nExplore it! :)<br>\n<img src=\"http://img211.imageshack.us/img211/8633/thmworld20070411su2.png\"><p>\nThis map represent current status of the Stendhal World. It only shows the ground level to avoid spoiling interesting dungeons. Some areas in the south east are only on our cvs right now but still created.<p>\n<hr width=95%>\n<h2>Sheep</h2>\nOnce you have bought a sheep it will follow you wherever you go. It's your job to protect and feed it.<p>\n\nThe icon shown in the upper-right corner of the sheep will show you what it is thinking.<p>\n\n    * A yellow man means it is currently following you. <br>\n<img src=\"http://www.j-a-r-n-o.nl/following.png\"><p>\n    *  A hamburger means it would like to eat. Your sheep will go to the nearest food source. <br>\n<img src=\"http://www.j-a-r-n-o.nl/eating.png\"><p>\n    *  Little feet means it is just wandering around. This sheep isn't owned by anyone (anymore). <br>\n<img src=\"http://www.j-a-r-n-o.nl/wandering.png\"><p>\nSheep like to eat fruits. These fruits can be found on the many bushes in Stendhal. A bush can carry up to five fruits. Over time these will grow back. So if your sheep has eaten all of it, it's time to move to the next bush. <br>\n<img src=\"http://www.myimagebuddy.com/uploads/c552734318.png\"><p>\n<b>Right Click</b> on your sheep and choose <b>Look</b> to see how fat it has become. The fatter the sheep, the more you will get for it when you sell it.<p>\n\nSheeps aren't very intelligent. So if your sheep gets stuck or isn't near you just write <b>sheep</b> and it will start moving to your position. You can verify the sheep's position by writing <b>/where sheep</b>.\n\nUnfortunately once you own a sheep you can't leave the zone without your sheep being near you. So make sure it is near before trying to leave. If you are in a hurry you can leave your sheep. To leave your sheep right click on <b>yourself</b> and choose <b>leave sheep</b>.<p>\n\nSometimes sheep are silly and they trap you. If this happens, then leave your sheep. He'll walk away then when you're free you can <b>own</b> him again.<p>\n\nYou can also own a released wild sheep again by right clicking on <b>it</b> and choosing <b>own</b>. \n<hr width=95%>\n<h2>Outfit</h2>\nOutfit helps you to feel the real role playing experience.<br>\nYou can choose your outfit by mixing a set of different styles of bodies, heads, hairs and clothes. <br>\n<img src=\"http://arianne.sourceforge.net/wiki_images/manual_17.jpg\"><p>\nTo bring up the dialog <b>Right Click</b> your character and choose <b>Set Outfit</b>. Click OK when you are done.<p>\n\nYou can also choose not to wear clothes at all :)<br>\nIf you just close the window nothing will be changed. <br>\n<hr width=95%>\n<h2>Combat</h2>\nCombat is an important way of increasing your level. You only get experience by killing. You can't improve your skills by training like in other games.\n\nWhen a creature is attacking you, it has a yellow square round it and you have a red square around you.<br>\n\nTo attack a creature simply <b>right click</b> on it and choose <b>Attack</b> or <b>double-click</b> it. You will see that a red box appears almost immediately around it. This indicates an attack is being carried out. You need to be next to the target in order to actually hit them though! <br>\n<img src=\"http://www.myimagebuddy.com/uploads/e3e46ef1df.png\"><p>\nYour attack will continue until:<p>\n\n    * you stop it using \"Stop attack\" action<br>\n    * you press ESC<br>\n    * you change zone (area)<br>\n    * your target is dead <p>\n\nCombat is round based, and each round last around 1.6 seconds. Each round the attack is resolved and the result is displayed in the right-bottom corner of the target:<p>\n\n    * a cloud means you failed to hit the target.<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.myimagebuddy.com/uploads/b0e504cdbc.png\"><br>\n   *  A shield means you hit the target but were unable to damage it.<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.myimagebuddy.com/uploads/82df4b5dc5.png\"><br>\n   * a blood drop means you hit the target and damaged it. Also you will see a red number pop out of the target indicating the amount of damage actually done.<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.myimagebuddy.com/uploads/d0df8ae4c9.png\"><br>\n   * If you kill your target you will see a blue number pop out which is the experience reward you have gained.<br>\n<img src=\"http://www.myimagebuddy.com/uploads/d0df8ae4c9.png\"><p>\nOnce you have killed your target it is important that you inspect its corpse to find money, food and other items: move next to the corpse and <b>right click</b> on it and choose <b>inspect</b> (you can also <b>double-click</b> to inspect). You can identify any kind of item you find at any time by right clicking on it and choosing look.\nTo store items in your bag you can move them there by <b>drag and drop</b> or simply <b>double-click</b> them.\n<hr width=95%>\n<h2>Levels</h2>\nYour character has a level attribute that expresses how strong that character is.<br>\nLevels are the only way of comparing your character against others.<p>\n\nWith each kill or quest completed you are rewarded experience points (XP). If you get enough XP you will level up. <p>\n<hr width=95%>\n<h1>Support</h1>\nIf you need (technical) help you can reach admin using /support. For general queries, hints and tips, try asking any high level player.<p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n");
