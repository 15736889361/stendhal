/**
 * A gold source is a spot where a player can prospect for gold nuggets. He
 * needs a gold pan, time, and luck.
 * 
 * Prospecting takes 7-11 seconds; during this time, the player keep standing
 * next to the gold source. In fact, the player only has to be there when the
 * prospecting action has finished. Therefore, make sure that two gold sources
 * are always at least 5 sec of walking away from each other, so that the player
 * can't prospect for gold at several sites simultaneously.
