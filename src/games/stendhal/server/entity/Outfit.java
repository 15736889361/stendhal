/**
 * A data structure that represents the outfit of an RPEntity. This RPEntity can
 * either be an NPC which uses the outfit sprite system, or of a player.
 * 
 * You can use this data structure so that you don't have to deal with the way
 * outfits are stored internally.
 * 
 * An outfit can contain of up to four parts: hair, head, dress, and base.
 * 
 * Note, however, that you can create outfit objects that consist of less than
 * four parts by setting the other parts to <code>null</code>. For example,
 * you can create a dress outfit that you can combine with the player's current
 * so that the player gets the dress, but keeps his hair, head, and base.
