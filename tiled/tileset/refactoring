# A list of all questioned files in the tileset so we can say what needs redrawing
# Check first if the tile is actually in use in any/many maps (use search for this)
# It would be fine to remove it from CVS if it is not used in any maps 
# If used in very few and not crucial, consider removing from map then remove from CVS
#
# Key: who is doing or has done what:
# k means kiheru 
# d means deleted as not used in maps
# letter then * means done and committed
