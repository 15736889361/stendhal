These code and files works with Tiled 0.5.0

Only the write code is written for the plugin and it will save the map with the name given to the different layers that makes it.

To compile just copy tiled and plugin to the place where you unziped tiled and compile tiled again.

How to create a new map file
----------------------------
Create a new map file of any size, but with tile size of 32x32
Now click on tileset and add in this order:
- zelda_outside_0_chipset.png
- zelda_outside_1_chipset.png
- zelda_dungeon_0_chipset.png
- zelda_dungeon_1_chipset.png
- zelda_interior_0_chipset.png
- zelda_navigation_chipset.png
- zelda_objects_chipset.png
- zelda_collision_chipset.png
- zelda_building_0_tileset.png
- zelda_outside_2_chipset.png

Now create 5 layers:
- <map>_0_floor
- <map>_1_terrain
- <map>_2_object
- <map>_3_roof
- <map>_4_roof_add
- <map>_objects
- <map>_collision
- <map>_navigation


They should appear on the top of them all navigation.

Alternatively you can use template.tmx for an empty framework of 128x128

Now simply draw your map.
Objects in roof and roof_add apears over any other object that is drawn.
Objects contain objects that will be inserted in the world, add at least one zone entry or zone change object.

Finally draw in red the areas the objects won't be able to enter.

Now save the map as <map>.tmx AND save as <map>.stend
This will create several files on tiled folder from where you ran the program. Copy these files to build/games/stendhal/server/maps. Finally edit StendhalRPWorld to know about the new files and modify StendhalRPAction.decideLeaveZone method so that your zone is reachable.
