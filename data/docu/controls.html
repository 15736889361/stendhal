</p><p>Click on the <b>Login to Stendhal</b> button and enter your account information.<br>

on Login to Server.<br>
</p><p><img src="controls_files/manual_001.jpg" alt="manual_001.jpg">

</p><p>If the server is down (not online) you will get an error message
explaining this. In this case either try again later or create a new
account on another server.

<a name="Basic_controls"></a><h2>Basic controls</h2>
<a name="Move"></a><h3>Move</h3>
<p>Use the <b>keyboard arrows</b> to move around on the Map.
</p><p><img src="controls_files/872976a7b2.png" alt="872976a7b2.png">
</p><p>You must hold down the direction keys to make the character to
move. Your character will collide with elements that exists on the
world, like other players and walls.
</p><p>Alternatively you can move by double clicking on an empty place of the game area.
</p><p>You also collide with map borders. When you reach a map border your screen won't move any further and two things might happen:
</p>
<ul><li> if an area exists next to the area you are in, you will move
from your current area to the new area (you will be transfered to the
new zone).
</li><li> if no area exists nothing will happen and you will simply collide and stop.
</li></ul>
<a name="Movement-lock_trick"></a><h4>Movement-lock trick</h4>
<p>If you make the graphics window lose the focus while keeping an
arrow key pressed, your character will keep going in that direction.
</p><p>When your character collides with an object or changes zones it
will stop, but you can resume its movement in the locked direction by
pressing an arrow key of a different direction.
</p><p>The movement-lock is released only when you press the arrow key of the locked direction of movement.
</p>
<a name="Passing_Through_Doors"></a><h3>Passing Through Doors</h3>
<p>You can simply pass through the doorway by using the <b>keyboard arrows</b>.
In the case that there is someone standing in front of the doorway and
blocking it you still can pass through the door if you can get next to
the door diagonally: just <b>right click</b> on the door and choose <b>use</b>.
</p>
<a name="Moving_With_An_Animal"></a><h3>Moving With An Animal</h3>
<p>If you have an animal following you such as a sheep, to change zones
the animal MUST be within visible distance from your charater. To find
out where your animal is, type <b>/where &lt;name of animal&gt;</b> ... for example <b>/where sheep</b>
</p>
<a name="Face"></a><h3>Face</h3>
<p>When attacking someone or talking to someone it is nice to face them. To do this press <b>Ctrl and a directional arrow</b> to face in that direction.
It is just an eye candy action as it has no effect on the game rules.
</p>
<h3>Moving Items</h3>
<p>During the game you will find or buy items such as swords and shields. To move these items around the world, use the <b>left click and drag</b>
to the place you want them to be. You need to be next to the item. To
drop a smaller amount of a stackable item use the /drop command. Say
you have 2000 money and want to give 100 money away: <code>/drop 100 money</code>
</p>
<h3>Managing Inventory</h3>
<p>You can manage your inventory by dressing items, dropping them to
floor or by storing them on your backpack. On all the cases the
procedure is the same: click on the item and drop it to the desired
position.
</p><p>Keep in mind that you must be near an item to equip it and that you can't drop it further than 8 positions from you.
</p><p><img src="controls_files/aada91f09e.png" alt="aada91f09e.png">
</p><p>Drag and drop the item in inventory slot you want.
</p><p><img src="controls_files/68db269bb7.png" alt="68db269bb7.png">
</p><p>And you have equipped it.
</p><p><img src="controls_files/6f9d28a0b8.png" alt="6f9d28a0b8.png">
</p><p>You can equip any item in any slot right now, but this will change.
</p>
<h3> Other actions </h3>

</p><p><img src="controls_files/75fc9949fd.png" alt="75fc9949fd.png">
</p>
<h3>Open Game Dialog log</h3>
<p>In case you have closed the game dialog (the window where all the text and game information appears) you can open it again with <b>Ctrl+L</b> (hold Control Key and L key) 
</p><p><img src="controls_files/manual_008.jpg" alt="manual_008.jpg">
</p><p>This dialog contains all the important events that happen in game so it is advised to have it visible.
</p><p>Use <b>Shift+UP arrow</b> or <b>Shift+DOWN arrow</b> (hold <i>Shift</i> and press arrows) to put in your dialog text bar the last written sentence. Each time you press the <i>up</i> arrow (while still holding the <i>shift</i> key) you go further back in the history of your previously written sentences. When you use the <i>down arrow</i> instead you can go forward. That way you don't have to write again previously used sentences, for example, when you sell items.
</p>
<a name="Exit_game"></a><h3>Exit game</h3>
<p>Press <b>ESC</b> to exit. You will be prompted again to either
really quit or return to the game. Alternatively you can simply close

<a name="Player_communication"></a><h2>Player communication</h2>
<p>To communicate with other players simply type! Press <b>Enter</b> to
send your chat message. A chat bubble will appear under your character
and a new line will appear in the Game log dialog. This kind of
communication is public and visible to every player in world, although
you will only see text for players near you.
</p><p>Alternatively you can write: 
</p>
<pre> <b>/tell playername <i>chat Content</i></b> 
</pre>

</pre>
<a name="Finding_persons"></a><h3> Finding persons </h3>

</p>
<pre> <b>/who</b>
</pre>

</p><p>You can find out a players position by querying server using /where <i>player name</i>
</p>
<pre> <b>/where miguel</b>
</pre>
<a name="Getting_help"></a><h3> Getting help </h3>
