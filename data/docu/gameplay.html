<a name="Characters_.2F_Learning_About_Quests"></a><h2>Characters / Learning About Quests</h2>
<p>You can and need to talk to other characters to get help and to find out about quests to complete.<br>
</p><p>There are two kind of characerers:
</p>
<ul><li> Other Players with their name printed in white
</li><li> Non Player Characters (NPC) with their name printed in light blue
</li></ul>
<p>All of the NPCs reply to <b>Hi</b> (most of them reply also to <b>Hello</b> and <b>Hola</b>), so greet them and ask them for <b>help</b>, their <b>offer</b>, or <b>quests</b>.
</p><p>Some of them will <b>sell</b> and <b>buy</b> sheep or items, others <b>heal</b> you, and others are simply <i>"useless"</i>
</p><p><img src="player-with-sheep.png" alt="Nishiya sells sheep." title="The pale blue coloured names show you they are an NPC.">
</p><p>An example of a conversation with Xin Blanca could be:
</p>
<pre> &lt;miguel&gt; hi
 &lt;Xin Blanca&gt; Greetings! How may I help you?
 &lt;miguel&gt; help
 &lt;Xin Blanca&gt; I buy and sell several items, ask me for my offer
 &lt;miguel&gt; offer
 &lt;Xin Blanca&gt; Please look at the blackboards on the wall to see what I buy and sell.
 &lt;miguel&gt; buy leather_legs
 &lt;Xin Blanca&gt; leather_legs costs 30. Do you want to buy?
 &lt;miguel&gt; yes
 &lt;Xin Blanca&gt; Congratulations! Here is your leather_legs!
 &lt;miguel&gt; Bye
 &lt;Xin Blanca&gt; Bye.
</pre>
<p>Sometimes you can buy more than one item at the same time:
</p>
<pre> &lt;miguel&gt; buy 10 minor_potion
</pre>
<p>Notice that names of items doesn't contain spaces between words
(they use _ as separator) and the name of the item is always singular
independently of the amount being bought.
</p><p>You can also get more than one item produced at once:
</p>
<pre> &lt;miguel&gt; mill 10 flour
 &lt;Jenny&gt; I can only mill 10 flour if you bring me 50 grain.
</pre>
<p>Some NPCs like to talk to you. If they say something in <font color="blue">blue</font> you can repeat it to get further information.
</p>
<pre> &lt;Tad&gt; I have a <font color="blue">task</font> for you.
 &lt;miguel&gt; task
 &lt;Tad&gt; I need you to get a flask from <font color="blue">Margaret</font>
</pre>
<a name="Items"></a><h2>Items</h2>
<p>Items such as armour and weapons can be found in the Stendhal world, or bought for hard earned cash.
(Hint: Explore the tavern, I've heard a shady character goes there to sell his stuff... though it might be stolen!) 
</p><p>Items increase your Attack or Defence values accordingly. They
must be equipped by dragging them onto a particular section of the
player in the Top right GUI. This little representation of your player
allows you to visualise what they are wearing/using.
</p>

<a name="Sheep"></a><h2>Sheep</h2>
<p>Once you have bought a sheep it will follow you wherever you go. It's your job to protect and feed it.
</p><p>The icon shown in the upper-right corner of the sheep will show you what it is thinking.
</p>
<ul><li> A yellow man means it is currently following you.
</li></ul>
<p><img src="following.png" alt="following.png">
</p>
<ul><li> A hamburger means it would like to eat. Your sheep will go to the nearest food source.
</li></ul>
<p><img src="eating.png" alt="eating.png">
</p>
<ul><li> Little feet means it is just wandering around. This sheep isn't owned by anyone (anymore).
</li></ul>
<p><img src="wandering.png" alt="wandering.png">
</p><p>Sheep like to eat fruits. These fruits can be found on the many bushes in Stendhal.
A bush can carry up to five fruits. Over time these will grow back.
So if your sheep has eaten all of it, it's time to move to the next bush.
</p><p><img src="aeryberry-bush.png" alt="Aeryberries are small red berries.">
</p><p><b>Right Click</b> on your sheep and choose <b>Look</b> to see how fat it has become. The fatter the sheep, the more you will get for it when you sell it.
</p><p>Sheeps aren't very intelligent. So if your sheep gets stuck or isn't near you just write <b>sheep</b> and it will start moving to your position. You can verify the sheep's position by writing <b>/where sheep</b>.
</p><p>Unfortunately once you own a sheep you can't leave the zone
without your sheep being near you. So make sure it is near before
trying to leave. If you are in a hurry you can leave your sheep. To
leave your sheep right click on <b>yourself</b> and choose <b>leave sheep</b>. 
</p><p>Sometimes sheep are silly and they trap you. If this happens,
then leave your sheep. He'll walk away then when you're free you can <b>own</b> him again.
</p><p>You can also own a released <i>wild sheep</i> again by right clicking on <b>it</b> and choosing <b>own</b>.
</p>
<a name="Outfit"></a><h2>Outfit</h2>
<p>Outfit helps you to feel the real role playing experience.<br>
You can choose your outfit by mixing a set of different styles of bodies, heads, hairs and clothes.
</p><p><img src="set-outfit.png" alt="There is a slider to show different positions.">
</p><p>To bring up the dialog <b>Right Click</b> your character and choose <b>Set Outfit</b>. Click OK when you are done.
</p><p>You can also choose not to wear clothes at all&nbsp;:)<br>
If you just close the window nothing will be changed.
</p>
<a name="Combat"></a><h2>Combat</h2>
<p>Combat is an important way of increasing your level. You only get
experience by killing. You can't improve your skills by training like
in other games.
</p><p>When a creature is attacking you, it has a yellow square round it and you have a red square around you. 
</p><p>To attack a creature simply <b>right click</b> on it and choose <b>Attack</b> or <b>double-click</b>
it. You will see that a red box appears almost immediately around it.
This indicates an attack is being carried out. You need to be next to
the target in order to actually hit them though!
</p><p><img src="attacked.png" alt="The yellow square round something attacking you is useful, so you know who your enemies are.">
</p><p>Your attack will continue until:
</p>
<ul><li> you stop it using "Stop attack" action
</li><li> you press ESC
</li><li> you change zone (area)
</li><li> your target is dead
</li></ul>
<p>Combat is round based, and each round last around 1.6 seconds.
Each round the attack is resolved and the result is displayed in the right-bottom corner of the target:
</p>
<ul><li> a cloud means you failed to hit the target.<br>
</li></ul>
<p><img src="cloud.png" alt="Failing to hit: cloud">
</p>
<ul><li> a shield means you hit the target but that you were unable to damage it.<br>
</li></ul>
<p><img src="defend.png" alt="Defending the hit: shield">
</p>
<ul><li> a blood drop means you hit the target and damaged it. Also you
will see a red number pop out of the target indicating the amount of
damage actually done.<br>
</li></ul>
<p><img src="blood.png" alt="Making damage: blood drop">
</p><p>If you kill your target you will see a blue number pop out which is the experience reward you have gained.
</p><p><img src="experience.png" alt="Experience points are also recorded in the chat and events dialog." title="Experience points are also recorded in the chat and events dialog.">
</p><p>Once you have killed your target it is important that you
inspect its corpse to find money, food and other items: move next to
the corpse and <b>right click</b> on it and choose <b>inspect</b> (you can also <b>double-click</b> to inspect). You can identify any kind of item you find at any time by right clicking on it and choosing look.<br>
To store items in your bag you can move them there by <b>drag and drop</b> or simply <b>double-click</b> them.
</p>
<a name="Levels"></a><h2>Levels</h2>
<p>Your character has a level attribute that expresses how strong that character is.<br>
Levels are the only way of comparing your character against others.
</p><p>With each kill or quest completed you are rewarded experience points (XP). If you get enough XP you will level up. 
</p><p>To see how much experience is needed to change level, checkout the <a href="http://arianne.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php?title=LevelTables" title="LevelTables">Level Progression Tables</a>.
